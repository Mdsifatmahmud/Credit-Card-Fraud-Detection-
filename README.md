The objective of this Resampling Techniques is to apply and compare different resampling techniques—specifically, crossvalidation, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), k-fold cross-validation, 
and bootstrapping—using three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). 
You will evaluate the performance of these models using metrics derived from the confusion matrix: accuracy, precision, recall, g-mean, f1 score.
